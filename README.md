## VSPDriver - Virtual Serial Port Driver

This is a macOS DriverKit driver implementation including a user interface App.
 
### Current development status

- Without a port link, the data is sent back to the sender
- With a port link, the data is written from sender 1 to receiver 2 and vice versa
- The client app provide installation, deinstallation and management

### Release

- [All releases](https://github.com/britus/VSPClient_Releases)

### Log Files and Tester

Create a small script which filter all VSPxxx messages.

```
#!/bin/sh

## Watch VSPDriver activity by log stream
filter="VSPDriver|VSPUserClient|VSPSerialPort"

sudo log stream --level debug \
    --color always \
    --style compact \
    --predicate 'process == "kernel"' | egrep ${filter}
```

## Notes for DIY

To build this project you have to do:

### Build the VSPDriver project with all frameworks inside

### Entitlements, signing and security checks

You should use your own bundle IDs in targets VSPDriver and VSPClient.

Replace bundle ID "org.eof.tools.VSPDriver" in the Xcode VSPDriver target and replace 
bundle ID "org.eof.tools.VSPClient" in the Xcode VSPClient target

After that you must replace the Dext bundle ID "org.eof.tools.VSPDriver" in 
VSPClient.entitlements file.

### Update source code to install the Dext

Change the the bundle ID in "VSPClient/DriverManager.swift".

## VSPDriver without any signing and security checks.

### The macOS System Integrity Protection (SIP)

Turning off SIP is only possible in the Recovery OS. To do this for your 
hardware, follow the instructions in [Apple's documentation](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Turning+off+SIP).

In the Recovery OS, open the terminal window from the main menu and enter 
following command:

### Disable the protection on the machine. 

```
$> csrutil disable
```

### Enable the protection on the machine.

```
$> csrutil enable
```

### Clear the existing configuration.

```
$> csrutil clear
```

### Setup NVRAM to disable signing checks

```
$> sudo nvram boot-args="dk=0x8001"
```

### Delete NVRAM boot-args

```
$> sudo nvram -d boot-args
```

### Enable developer mode for system extensions

```
$> systemextensionsctl developer on
```

### Disable developer mode for system extensions

```
$> systemextensionsctl developer off
```
